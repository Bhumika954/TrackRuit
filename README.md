Project Overview
Track-Ruit is a web application built with React, designed to help users explore job postings and track their resumes. It allows users to browse various job openings, view detailed descriptions of each job, and upload/manage their resumes. The application is built using Create React App, a popular framework for building single-page applications with React.
Key Features and Functionality
Job Exploration:

The homepage  displays an "Explore Jobs" section with a grid of job cards.
Each job card provides essential information like Job Title, Company, and Location. Examples include "Software Developer-DC Area," "Software Engineer," and ".NET Software Developer Jobs."
A "View Details" button on each card allows users to navigate to a dedicated page for more in-depth job descriptions.
Detailed Job View:

Clicking "View Details" (e.g., for "Software Developer (Junior, Mid and Senior)" from Spry Methods, Inc.) leads to a comprehensive job description page 
This page includes:
Basic Information: Company, Location, Remote status, Job Type, and Posted At.
Position Overview: A general description of the role.
Daily Responsibilities: A bulleted list outlining the day-to-day tasks.
Required Skills and Experience: Detailed list of technical skills (e.g., JavaScript, Python, React, Node.js, .NET, C#), tools (Git, GitLab CI/CD, Jira, Kubernetes, Docker), and methodologies (Agile Practices, SAFe Agile).
At the bottom of the detailed job view, "Apply Now" and "Go Back" buttons are present.
Resume Tracking:

The "Tracker" link in the navigation bar leads to a "Resume Tracker" page 
This feature enables users to upload their resumes.
Uploaded resumes are displayed with their filename (e.g., "Bhumika_S_Resume.pdf") and a "Delete" option, allowing users to manage their uploaded files.
Technical Stack and Development Environment
The project is bootstrapped with Create React App, implying a core stack of:

Frontend Framework: React.js
Language: JavaScript (likely ES6+)
Build Tool: Webpack (configured by Create React App)
Transpiler: Babel (configured by Create React App)
Package Manager: npm
Available Scripts for Local Development
The standard Create React App scripts are available for local development:

npm start:

Runs the app in development mode.
Opens http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
Features live reloading on code changes.
Displays lint errors in the console.
npm test:

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
Used for running unit and integration tests.
npm run build:

Builds the app for production.
Outputs optimized and minified static files into the build folder.
Ready for deployment to production environments.
npm run eject:

A one-way operation that removes the single build dependency of Create React App.
Copies all configuration files (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into the project, giving the developer full control over the build process.
Generally not recommended unless deep customization is required.
Deployment (Vercel)
The application is deployed on Vercel for public access.

Access the live application here: https://track-ruit.vercel.app/

To deploy this React application to Vercel:

Ensure your project is set up as a Git repository (e.g., on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
Build the application for production: While Vercel often handles this automatically for Create React App projects, you would typically run npm run build in your project's root directory. This creates a build folder containing all the static files.
Connect Vercel to your Git repository:
Log in to Vercel.
Click "Add New..." -> "Project."
Choose your Git provider and select your repository.
Configure Build Settings on Vercel:
Vercel usually auto-detects Create React App projects.
The Build Command will typically be npm run build (or yarn build).
The Output Directory (or "Root Directory" for the build output) will be build.
If you choose to use the Vercel CLI, you can navigate to your project directory and run vercel to deploy.
Deploy: Confirm the settings and initiate the deployment. Vercel will then pull your code, run the build command, and deploy the contents of the build folder to a live URL. Subsequent pushes to your configured Git branch will trigger automatic redeployments.
Conclusion
Track-Ruit is a well-structured React application for job searching and resume management. Its use of Create React App simplifies development and provides a robust foundation. Deploying to Vercel is a seamless process, making the application easily accessible to the public.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
